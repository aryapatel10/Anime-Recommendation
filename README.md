# Anime-Recommendation
A personalised anime recommendation system using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze and suggest similar anime titles.

This project successfully implements an anime recommendation system using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.
By utilizing libraries such as 'pandas', 'nltk', 'scikit-learn', and 'pickle', the system processes and analyzes textual data to provide personalized anime recommendations. 
The workflow included data loading, cleaning, preparation, text stemming, vectorization, and cosine similarity calculation. The recommendation function effectively suggests similar anime titles based on these similarity scores. The system's functionality was validated through multiple test cases, proving its accuracy and relevance.
